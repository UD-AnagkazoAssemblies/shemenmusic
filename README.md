# Introduction
UD has a current website (http://shemenmusic.com/victory/)[http://shemenmusic.com/victory/], however, this version is super slow and laggy. It sometimes take v
forever to get what you need.   
This platform is an initiative to implement a completely new thing to achieve the same and more but in a more efficient way. 
This platform uses `web scraping` mechanism to fetch data from the current website, but it takes time only if it has never been search by anyone from this 
platform. The moment the resources is searched on this platform, it checks our db if it exists and returns it instantly, if not, it scrapes it from the existing website 
and saves it to our db for a quicker response time next time.
